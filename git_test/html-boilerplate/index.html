    <h1>Hello World, I will defeat banking</h1>
    <p> I will <strong>defeat banking</strong> by overcoming the test of coding. Once
        I have developed this skill, I will <em> pave my own way to success </em>
        and avoid the catastrophe of working for a company who cares so
        little about me.</p>
        <!-- My thoughts on my current life-->
    <p> Everything I am, do and believe is for my children. For what is man without
        the pure, innocent love of their offspring. 
        <!-- My love for my kids is first before all-->
